TDL(Transmission Dynamic Library)
===

TDL (Transmission Dynamic Library) is a library developed for Vehicle Transmission.

This library focuses on supporting development of transmission control software, and is designed to be an open-source library.

Detailed models are provided for describing dynamic behaviors of fix-axis gearbox. This library is partly compatible with VehicleInterface library and provides a method for importing *.dll generated by Simulink. A fault trigger is method is also provided.

We now use OpenModelica as our simulation tool. More work is needed, and we need chance to use this library in real vehicle transmission developing process.
